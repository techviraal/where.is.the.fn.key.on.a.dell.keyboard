Function (Fn) Key Guide for Dell Laptops 0 Between the ctrl and Windows key on the lower left-hand corner of your laptop keyboard resides the function (Fn) key. It is displayed as Fn on the key itself.

## How to Fix the Fn Function on a Dell Computer

The "Fn" key on a Dell toggles the multimedia keys on and off. On some models, you must press "Fn" to activate these multimedia keys, but the keyboard operation can be changed on the Dell PC so that the multimedia keys are always on. This setting, however, can interfere with your work; some enterprise applications assign special functions to certain keys on the keyboard and Dell may override these functions if the key in question is also a multimedia key. You can change the settings on the Dell so that the multimedia keys activate only when "Fn" is pressed.

* Turn on or reboot the computer. Press "F2" on the Dell logo screen to enter the BIOS settings.
* Use the arrow keys to select the "Advanced" tab. Scroll down to "Function Key Behavior."
* Press "+" or "-" to change the setting to "Function Key First." Go to the "Exit" tab.
* Select "Exit Saving Changes" and then press "Enter" to fix the function key on the Dell and restart the computer.

## How to Unlock the Dell Fn Key

* Press and hold the "Fn" key, which is located in the lower left corner of your keyboard, to the left of the "Ctrl" key and to the right of the "Windows" key. Holding the "Fn" key down, tap the "Num Lk" key at the upper right corner of the keyboard to unlock the "Fn" key.
* Hold down the "Fn" key and tap the "F3" key to bring up the Dell battery monitor screen. Tap "Fn" and "F10" together to eject the disk drive.
* Hold down the "Fn" key and tap the up arrow key to increase the screen's brightness, or press the down arrow key to decrease the screen's brightness. Repeatedly tapping one of the keys increases or decreases the brightness to its maximum or minimum.
* Tap the "Page Up" key while the "Fn" key is depressed to manually raise the laptop's volume. Use the "Page Down" key to lower the volume.
* Press "F2" along with the "Fn" key to turn on or off the laptop's wireless card. Press "F1" with the "Fn" key held down to put the laptop into hibernate mode, which saves power while you aren't actively using the computer.
